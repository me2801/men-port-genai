# Email Drafting Agent

## Problem Statement

This project implements an Email Drafting Agent as part of the GenAI Hackathon Pre-Hackathon Mini Challenge #2.

The goal is to build an agent that transforms bullet-point-style input into a clear, professional email draft. The agent produces polished emails with a natural tone and respectful style.

### The agent accepts:
- Recipient’s name and/or role
- Purpose of the email
- Key details or points to include (bullet points)

### And returns a well-structured email containing:
- A subject line
- A natural and respectful greeting
- A concise body covering all key information
- A professional closing

The agent is designed to run on the GenAI AgentOS platform.

## Quickstart Guide

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/me2801/men-port-genai.git
cd challenges
cd men-port-genai
cd 02-email-drafting-agent
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project containing the following:

```bash
OPENAPI_KEY=<your OpenAI API key>
AGENT_JWT=<your GenAI AgentOS JWT token>
```

- Get your OpenAI API key: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
- Get your GenAI JWT token: see the GenAI AgentOS documentation.

### 3. Set up and activate the virtual environment using uv

If you don’t have `uv`, install it first:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Then create and activate the virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv
.venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows
# or
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
```

Sync the dependencies from `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
uv sync
```

### 4. Run the agent

Start the agent with:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

The agent will register with GenAI AgentOS and start processing incoming events.

## Functionality

The core functionality of this agent is to generate professional email drafts from minimal user input. 

### Inputs
- `recipient`: The recipient's name or role.
- `purpose`: The overall purpose of the email.
- `points`: A list of bullet points with the key information to include.

### Output
A professional email containing:
- A subject line
- A greeting addressing the recipient
- A concise, clear body covering the provided points
- A respectful closing

### Example

**Input:**
- Recipient: Hiring Manager
- Purpose: Application for Data Scientist position
- Points:
    - Completed Master’s in Data Science
    - 3 years of experience in machine learning
    - Passionate about innovative technologies

**Example Output:**
